# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction App

An interactive **Machine Learning + Streamlit web app** that predicts whether a telecom customer will **churn (leave)** or **stay** using a complete end-to-end pipeline built with **Logistic Regression**.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem in the telecom industry. This project builds a robust ML pipeline to:
- Analyze customer data  
- Handle class imbalance  
- Train an optimized model  
- Predict churn probability  
- Provide business insights  

The solution is deployed as an **interactive Streamlit application** where users can upload datasets and get real-time predictions.

## Results (on Telco Dataset)

| Metric       | Score |
|--------------|------:|
| Accuracy     | 0.737 |
| Recall       | 0.810 |
| Precision    | 0.503 |
| F1 Score     | 0.620 |
| ROC-AUC      | 0.838 |

### Insights
- High **recall (0.810)** → model captures most churn customers  
- Moderate **precision (0.503)** → some false positives exist  
- Balanced **F1 Score (0.620)** indicates overall stable performance  
- Strong **ROC-AUC (0.838)** shows good class separation ability
